## Legend
The bot is named after the Athenian warrior [Phidippides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheidippides), who, despite his fatigue and wounds, brought the news of the victory of the Athenian army over the Persians in the Battle of Marathon. And like a Fidippid, our bot delivers messages to the specified recipients as soon as possible no matter what.
